deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.","created_at":"2020-08-11T16:09:39.910Z","updated_at":"2023-09-22T16:58:59.988Z","scientific_name":"Prunus persica","parent_id":null,"adopter_id":null,"link":"/plants/prunus-persica-peach","thumb":"https://cdn.permapeople.org/egg2fqmca9lul0cztot4usdzxuen","type":"Species","tags":["Life cycle","Perennial","Light requirement","Full sun","Water requirement","Moist","Soil type","Light (sandy), Medium, Heavy (clay)","Layer","Trees","Edible","true","Edible parts","Flowers, Fruit, Seed","Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach","Growth","Fast","Alternate name","Flowering peach, ornamental peach, common peach","Family","Rosaceae","German name","Pfirsich, bergpfirsich, tellerpfirsich, saturnpfirsich, weinbergpfirsich","Edible uses","Oil","Plants For A Future","https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus persica","Native to","China North-Central","Introduced into","Afghanistan, Alabama, Argentina Northwest, Arizona, Arkansas, Assam, Baleares, Bulgaria, California, Cape Verde, China South-Central, China Southeast, Colorado, Connecticut, Corse, Cyprus, Delaware, District of Columbia, East European Russia, East Himalaya, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Florida, France, Free State, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Idaho, Illinois, India, Indiana, Iowa, Iran, Italy, Japan, Kansas, Kazakhstan, Kentucky, Kenya, Kirgizstan, Korea, Kriti, Krym, KwaZulu-Natal, Laos, Libya, Louisiana, Maine, Marianas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mauritius, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New South Wales, New York, New Zealand North, North Carolina, North Caucasus, Northern Provinces, Nova Scotia, Ohio, Oklahoma, Ontario, Oregon, Pakistan, Pennsylvania, Portugal, Queensland, Rhode I., Rodrigues, Romania, Réunion, Sardegna, South Australia, South Carolina, South European Russi, St.Helena, Switzerland, Tadzhikistan, Tennessee, Texas, Transcaucasus, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Utah, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Virginia, West Himalaya, West Virginia, Wisconsin","Width","3","Plants of the World Online","https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:1212858-2","USDA Hardiness zone",["5","6","7","8","9"],"Height","up to 10m (~33ft)","Chill hours","not specified","Days to harvest","Days to maturity","Diseases","Drought resistant","Germination temperature","Germination time","Habitat","Leaves","Medicinal","Medicinal parts","Pests","Propagation -

Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.\r\n\r\nApples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means.

It is native to China and is closely related to the peach. Nectarines are similar in appearance to peaches, but have smooth skin rather than fuzzy skin. They can range in size from small to large and are typically round or oval in shape.\r\n\r\nNectarines have green or red leaves and white or pink flowers. The stems of the plant are generally thin and have thorns. Nectarines can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 8 meters. They grow best in warm, sunny climates and well-drained soil.\r\n\r\nTo cultivate nectarines successfully, a grower will need to provide the plant with plenty of sunlight and water. They may also need to prune the plant to maintain its shape and encourage new growth. Nectarines are edible and the fruit can be eaten fresh or cooked. The edible parts of the fruit can be stored in a cool, dry place after harvest.\r\n\r\nNectarines have several uses. In addition to being eaten fresh or cooked, they can also be used to make jams, jellies, and other preserves. They can also be dried and used as a snack. In addition to their culinary uses, nectarines have been used medicinally for their high vitamin and mineral content. They are also valued for their ability to attract wildlife, such as birds and bees, to the garden.","created_at":"2020-08-11T16:09:49.387Z","updated_at":"2023-05-10T13:15:31.005Z","scientific_name":"Prunus persica nucipersica","parent_id":null,"adopter_id":null,"link":"/plants/prunus-persica-nucipersica-nectarine","thumb":"https://cdn.permapeople.org/permapeople-permaculture-plant-database-blank.jpg","type":"Species","tags":["Life cycle","Perennial","Light requirement","Full sun","Water requirement","Moist","Soil type","Light (sandy), Medium, Heavy (clay)","Leaves","Deciduous","Layer","Trees","Utility","Animal feed, Attracts insects, Hedgerow, Wildlife habitat","Edible","True","Edible parts","Flowers, Fruit, Seed","Family","Rosaceae","German name","Nektarine","Edible uses","Oil","Plants For A Future","https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus persica nucipersica","Dutch name","Nectarine","Danish name","Nektarin","Width","3","USDA Hardiness zone",["4","5","6","7","8"],"Height","up to 10m (~33ft)","Chill hours","not specified","Days to harvest","Days to maturity","Diseases","Drought resistant","Germination temperature","Germination time","Growth","Habitat","Introduced into","Medicinal","Medicinal parts","Native to","Pests","Propagation - Cuttings","Propagation - Direct sowing","Propagation - Transplanting","Propagation method","Resistance","Root depth","Root type","Seed viability","Soil pH","Spacing","Type","Warning","When to plant (cuttings)","When to plant (division)","When to plant (transplant)","When to sow (indoors)","When to sow (outdoors)","When to start indoors (weeks)","When to start outdoors (weeks)","Years to bear"],"Life cycle":"Perennial","Light requirement":"Full sun","Water requirement":"Moist","Soil type":["Light (sandy)","Medium","Heavy (clay)"],"Leaves":"Deciduous","Layer":"Trees","Utility":["Animal feed","Attracts insects","Hedgerow","Wildlife habitat"],"Edible":"True","Edible parts":["Flowers","Fruit","Seed"],"Family":"Rosaceae","German name":"Nektarine","Edible uses":"Oil","Plants For A Future":"https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus persica nucipersica","Dutch name":"Nectarine","Danish name":"Nektarin","Width":"3","USDA Hardiness zone":["4","5","6","7","8"],"Height":"up to 10m (~33ft)","Chill hours":"not specified","Days to harvest":"not specified","Days to maturity":"not specified","Diseases":"not specified","Drought resistant":"not specified","Germination temperature":"not specified","Germination time":"not specified","Growth":"not specified","Habitat":"not specified","Introduced into":"not specified","Medicinal":"not specified","Medicinal parts":"not specified","Native to":"not specified","Pests":"not specified","Propagation - Cuttings":"not specified","Propagation - Direct sowing":"not specified","Propagation - Transplanting":"not specified","Propagation method":"not specified","Resistance":"not specified","Root depth":"not specified","Root type":"not specified","Seed viability":"not specified","Soil pH":"not specified","Spacing":"not specified","Type":"not specified","Warning":"not specified","When to plant (cuttings)":"not specified","When to plant (division)":"not specified","When to plant (transplant)":"not specified","When to sow (indoors)":"not specified","When to sow (outdoors)":"not specified","When to start indoors (weeks)":"not specified","When to start outdoors (weeks)":"not specified","Years to bear":"not specified","companions":[],"antagonists":[],"has_images":0},"152":{"id":152,"name":"Northern Highbush Blueberry","slug":"vaccinium-corymbosum-northern-highbush-blueberry","description":"Northern Highbush Blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) is a type of blueberry plant native to the eastern and central United States and Canada.

With various species and numerous cultivars, pear trees are appreciated for their delicious fruit, attractive blossoms, and relatively easy maintenance.\r\n\r\nMost pear trees grow to a height of 12 to 20 feet, although some cultivars can reach up to 40 feet. They typically have a rounded, upright growth habit. Pear trees have glossy green leaves and produce beautiful white flowers in early to mid-spring, before the leaves emerge. These blossoms are not only visually appealing but also attract pollinators. \r\n\r\nPears come in a range of sizes and colors, typically yellow, green, or brown, and are known for their sweet, juicy flesh. The texture and flavor vary among cultivars, ranging from smooth and buttery to crisp and tangy.\r\n\r\nPear trees generally prefer cooler temperate climates but can adapt to a range of conditions. They are more cold-hardy than citrus but less so than apples. They thrive in well-drained, loamy soil and require full sun for optimal fruit production. Regular watering is important, especially during fruit development. Pruning is essential for maintaining tree health, encouraging fruit production, and managing size. Pear trees can be susceptible to several pests and diseases, including fire blight, pear scab, and codling moth. Integrated pest management strategies can help control these issues.\r\n\r\nPear trees can be part of a diverse polyculture system, where they can be interplanted with various understory crops and beneficial companions to enhance overall ecosystem health. They can improve soil health through leaf litter and create beneficial microclimates in a permaculture setting.","created_at":"2020-11-13T18:52:08.999Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T17:05:49.041Z","scientific_name":"Pyrus communis","parent_id":null,"adopter_id":1461,"link":"/plants/pyrus-communis-pear","thumb":"https://cdn.permapeople.org/jzodgf7a2vihqbk4keua8cprm0sx","type":"Species","tags":["Light requirement","Full sun, Partial sun/shade","Water requirement","Moist","Soil type","Light (sandy), Medium, Heavy (clay)","Layer","Trees","Edible","true","Edible parts","Fruit","Family","Rosaceae","Plants For A Future","https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pyrus communis sativa","Nitrogen Fixing","No","Nitrogen Usage","Medium","USDA Hardiness zone",["4","5","6","7","8"],"Height","up to 5m (~16ft)","Chill hours","not specified","Days to harvest","Days to maturity","Diseases","Drought resistant","Edible uses","Germination temperature","Germination time","Growth","Habitat","Introduced into","Leaves","Life cycle","Medicinal","Medicinal parts","Native to","Pests","Propagation -
