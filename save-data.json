tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.","created_at":"2020-08-11T16:09:39.910Z","updated_at":"2023-09-22T16:58:59.988Z","scientific_name":"Prunus persica","parent_id":null,"adopter_id":null,"link":"/plants/prunus-persica-peach","thumb":"https://cdn.permapeople.org/egg2fqmca9lul0cztot4usdzxuen","type":"Species","tags":["Life cycle","Perennial","Light requirement","Full sun","Water requirement","Moist","Soil type","Light (sandy), Medium, Heavy (clay)","Layer","Trees","Edible","true","Edible parts","Flowers, Fruit, Seed","Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach","Growth","Fast","Alternate name","Flowering peach, ornamental peach, common peach","Family","Rosaceae","German name","Pfirsich, bergpfirsich, tellerpfirsich, saturnpfirsich, weinbergpfirsich","Edible uses","Oil","Plants For A Future","https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus persica","Native to","China North-Central","Introduced into","Afghanistan, Alabama, Argentina Northwest, Arizona, Arkansas, Assam, Baleares, Bulgaria, California, Cape Verde, China South-Central, China Southeast, Colorado, Connecticut, Corse, Cyprus, Delaware, District of Columbia, East European Russia, East Himalaya, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Florida, France, Free State, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Idaho, Illinois, India, Indiana, Iowa, Iran, Italy, Japan, Kansas, Kazakhstan, Kentucky, Kenya, Kirgizstan, Korea, Kriti, Krym, KwaZulu-Natal, Laos, Libya, Louisiana, Maine, Marianas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mauritius, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New South Wales, New York, New Zealand North, North Carolina, North Caucasus, Northern Provinces, Nova Scotia, Ohio, Oklahoma, Ontario, Oregon, Pakistan, Pennsylvania, Portugal, Queensland, Rhode I., Rodrigues, Romania, Réunion, Sardegna, South Australia, South Carolina, South European Russi, St.Helena, Switzerland, Tadzhikistan, Tennessee, Texas, Transcaucasus, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Utah, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Virginia, West Himalaya, West Virginia, Wisconsin","Width","3","Plants of the World Online","https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:1212858-2","USDA Hardiness zone",["5","6","7","8","9"],"Height","up to 10m (~33ft)","Chill hours","not specified","Days to harvest","Days to maturity","Diseases","Drought resistant","Germination temperature","Germination time","Habitat","Leaves","Medicinal","Medicinal parts","Pests","Propagation -

It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit, which is known for its sweet, slightly tangy flavor. The persimmon tree typically grows to be between 20 and 40 feet tall, with a spreading canopy. It has glossy, oblong leaves that are dark green in color, and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe persimmon fruit is oval in shape and can range in size from 1 to 4 inches in diameter. It has a thin, papery skin that ranges in color from orange to deep red. The fruit has a firm, slightly grainy texture and is often eaten when it is ripe and soft. The persimmon fruit is rich in vitamins A and C, as well as dietary fiber. It can be eaten fresh, or it can be dried and used in baking.\r\n\r\nPersimmon trees prefer well-drained, slightly acidic soil and full sun exposure. They are drought-tolerant and can be grown in a wide range of climates. In colder climates, persimmon trees can be grown in containers and brought indoors during the winter months. To cultivate persimmon trees successfully, they should be planted in the early spring and watered regularly during the first growing season.\r\n\r\nPersimmon trees can be propagated by planting seeds from the fruit, or by rooting stem cuttings. They are generally low maintenance and do not require pruning, although they may benefit from regular fertilization. Persimmon trees are winter hardy and can withstand temperatures as low as -20 degrees Fahrenheit. In areas with colder climates, it is important to provide the trees with proper protection in order to ensure their survival during the winter months.\r\n\r\nPersimmon trees are valued for their edible fruit, as well as their ornamental qualities. In addition to being eaten fresh, the fruit can be used to make jams, jellies, and other preserves. The leaves of the persimmon tree can be used as a natural dye, and the wood is often used in woodworking and for making furniture. Persimmon trees are also valued for their ability to provide food and shelter for wildlife, including birds, small mammals, and insects.","created_at":"2020-08-11T16:09:44.248Z","updated_at":"2024-02-14T09:17:25.623Z","scientific_name":"Diospyros kaki","parent_id":null,"adopter_id":1461,"link":"/plants/diospyros-kaki-persimmon","thumb":"https://cdn.permapeople.org/6f30oc1odxgccnxv48vswyycbpnd","type":"Species","tags":["Light requirement","Full sun, Partial sun/shade","Water requirement","Moist","Soil type","Light (sandy), Medium, Heavy (clay)","Leaves","Deciduous","Width","10","Life cycle","Perennial","Layer","Trees","Growth","Medium","Utility","Animal feed, Hedgerow, Wildlife habitat","Edible","true","Edible parts","Fruit","Alternate name","Japanese persimmon","German name","Kaki","Family","Ebenaceae","Native to","Assam, China North-Central, China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan, Taiwan, Vietnam","Introduced into","Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Japan, Korea, Nansei-shoto, Philippines, Queensland, Transcaucasus","Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diospyros_kaki","Plants For A Future","https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Diospyros kaki","Plants of the World Online","https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:322553-1","USDA Hardiness zone",["7","8","9","10"],"Height","up to 30m (~98ft)","Chill hours","not specified","Days to harvest","Days to maturity","Diseases","Drought resistant","Edible uses","Germination temperature","Germination time","Habitat","Medicinal","Medicinal parts","Pests","Propagation - Cuttings","Propagation - Direct sowing","Propagation - Transplanting","Propagation method","Resistance","Root depth","Root type","Seed viability","Soil pH","Spacing","Type","Warning","When to plant (cuttings)","When to plant (division)","When to plant (transplant)","When to sow (indoors)","When to sow (outdoors)","When to start indoors (weeks)","When to start outdoors (weeks)","Years to bear"],"Light requirement":["Full sun","Partial sun/shade"],"Water requirement":"Moist","Soil type":["Light (sandy)","Medium","Heavy (clay)"],"Leaves":"Deciduous","Width":"10","Life cycle":"Perennial","Layer":"Trees","Growth":"Medium","Utility":["Animal feed","Hedgerow","Wildlife habitat"],"Edible":"true","Edible parts":"Fruit","Alternate name":"Japanese persimmon","German name":"Kaki","Family":"Ebenaceae","Native to":["Assam","China North-Central","China South-Central","China Southeast","Hainan","Taiwan","Vietnam"],"Introduced into":["Bangladesh","Bulgaria","Japan","Korea","Nansei-shoto","Philippines","Queensland","Transcaucasus"],"Wikipedia":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diospyros_kaki","Plants For A Future":"https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Diospyros kaki","Plants of the World Online":"https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:322553-1","USDA Hardiness zone":["7","8","9","10"],"Height":"up to 30m (~98ft)","Chill hours":"not specified","Days to harvest":"not specified","Days to maturity":"not specified","Diseases":"not specified","Drought resistant":"not specified","Edible uses":"not specified","Germination temperature":"not specified","Germination time":"not specified","Habitat":"not specified","Medicinal":"not specified","Medicinal parts":"not specified","Pests":"not specified","Propagation - Cuttings":"not specified","Propagation - Direct sowing":"not specified","Propagation - Transplanting":"not specified","Propagation method":"not specified","Resistance":"not specified","Root depth":"not specified","Root type":"not specified","Seed viability":"not specified","Soil pH":"not specified","Spacing":"not specified","Type":"not specified","Warning":"not specified","When to plant (cuttings)":"not specified","When to plant (division)":"not specified","When to plant (transplant)":"not specified","When to sow (indoors)":"not specified","When to sow (outdoors)":"not specified","When to start indoors (weeks)":"not specified","When to start outdoors (weeks)":"not specified","Years to bear":"not specified","companions":[],"antagonists":[],"has_images":1},"76":{"id":76,"name":"Fig","slug":"ficus-carica-fig","description":"The fig, or Ficus carica, is a species of flowering plant in the mulberry family.

Its leaves are glossy and dark green, and are typically deeply lobed with three or five lobes. The fig tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are hidden inside the fruit. The fruit itself is a small, pear-shaped structure that is edible when ripe.\r\n\r\nWhen grown in favorable conditions, fig trees can grow quite large and can produce an abundance of fruit. They prefer well-drained soil and a warm, sunny climate, and can tolerate drought conditions once established. In colder climates, fig trees can be grown in containers and brought indoors during the winter to protect them from freezing temperatures.\r\n\r\nFig trees are typically not winter hardy, and will need to be protected from frost in colder climates. They can be grown successfully in a variety of soil types, but prefer a slightly acidic soil pH. Fig trees can be propagated from cuttings or by rooting the dormant buds on the tree's roots.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the fig tree is edible and can be eaten fresh or dried. The ripe fruit has a sweet, rich flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including jams, jellies, and pies. The fruit can also be dried and stored for later use.

Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.\r\n\r\nApples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\r\n\r\nWorldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total.\r\n\r\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple)","created_at":"2020-08-11T16:09:47.328Z","updated_at":"2024-08-25T19:09:21.041Z","scientific_name":"Malus domestica","parent_id":null,"adopter_id":1461,"link":"/plants/malus-domestica-apple","thumb":"https://cdn.permapeople.org/sdwapb6522tsbreeeieygd7xli9s","type":"Species","tags":["Light requirement","Full sun, Partial sun/shade","Water requirement","Moist","Soil type","Light (sandy), Medium, Heavy (clay)","Leaves","Deciduous","Width","9","Life cycle","Perennial","Layer","Trees","Utility","Animal feed, Attracts insects, Hedgerow","Edible","True","Edible parts","Fruit","Edible uses","Oil","Dutch name","Appel","Danish name","Æble","Family","Rosaceae","Genus","Malus","Native to","Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, Pakistan, Tadzhikistan, Uzbekistan, Xinjiang","Introduced into","Alabama, Alaska, Albania, Argentina Northeast, Argentina South, Arkansas, Azores, Baleares, Baltic States, Belarus, Belgium, British Columbia, Bulgaria, California, Central European Rus, Colorado, Connecticut, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Delaware, Denmark, District of Columbia, East European Russia, East Himalaya, Ecuador, Falkland Is., Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Kansas, Kentucky, Korea, Krym, Louisiana, Madeira, Maine, Manitoba, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nepal, Netherlands, Nevada, New Brunswick, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New South Wales, New York, Newfoundland, North Carolina, North Caucasus, North Dakota, Norway, Nova Scotia, Ohio, Ontario, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Poland, Prince Edward I., Québec, Rhode I., Romania, South Carolina, South European Russi, Spain, Sweden, Tasmania, Tennessee, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Utah, Vermont, Victoria, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Yugoslavia","Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple","Plants For A Future","https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Malus+domestica","Plants of the World Online","https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:726282-1","German name","Apfel","USDA Hardiness zone",["3","4","5","6","7","8"],"Height","up to 10m (~33ft)","Chill hours","not specified","Days to harvest","Days to maturity","Diseases","Drought resistant","Germination temperature","Germination time","Growth","Habitat","Medicinal","Medicinal parts","Pests","Propagation -

With various species and numerous cultivars, pear trees are appreciated for their delicious fruit, attractive blossoms, and relatively easy maintenance.\r\n\r\nMost pear trees grow to a height of 12 to 20 feet, although some cultivars can reach up to 40 feet. They typically have a rounded, upright growth habit. Pear trees have glossy green leaves and produce beautiful white flowers in early to mid-spring, before the leaves emerge. These blossoms are not only visually appealing but also attract pollinators. \r\n\r\nPears come in a range of sizes and colors, typically yellow, green, or brown, and are known for their sweet, juicy flesh. The texture and flavor vary among cultivars, ranging from smooth and buttery to crisp and tangy.\r\n\r\nPear trees generally prefer cooler temperate climates but can adapt to a range of conditions. They are more cold-hardy than citrus but less so than apples. They thrive in well-drained, loamy soil and require full sun for optimal fruit production. Regular watering is important, especially during fruit development. Pruning is essential for maintaining tree health, encouraging fruit production, and managing size. Pear trees can be susceptible to several pests and diseases, including fire blight, pear scab, and codling moth. Integrated pest management strategies can help control these issues.\r\n\r\nPear trees can be part of a diverse polyculture system, where they can be interplanted with various understory crops and beneficial companions to enhance overall ecosystem health. They can improve soil health through leaf litter and create beneficial microclimates in a permaculture setting.","created_at":"2020-11-13T18:52:08.999Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T17:05:49.041Z","scientific_name":"Pyrus communis","parent_id":null,"adopter_id":1461,"link":"/plants/pyrus-communis-pear","thumb":"https://cdn.permapeople.org/jzodgf7a2vihqbk4keua8cprm0sx","type":"Species","tags":["Light requirement","Full sun, Partial sun/shade","Water requirement","Moist","Soil type","Light (sandy), Medium, Heavy (clay)","Layer","Trees","Edible","true","Edible parts","Fruit","Family","Rosaceae","Plants For A Future","https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pyrus communis sativa","Nitrogen Fixing","No","Nitrogen Usage","Medium","USDA Hardiness zone",["4","5","6","7","8"],"Height","up to 5m (~16ft)","Chill hours","not specified","Days to harvest","Days to maturity","Diseases","Drought resistant","Edible uses","Germination temperature","Germination time","Growth","Habitat","Introduced into","Leaves","Life cycle","Medicinal","Medicinal parts","Native to","Pests","Propagation -

Native to Europe and parts of Asia, comfrey has been cultivated globally due to its versatility and usefulness.\r\n\r\nHistorically, comfrey has been used in traditional medicine for its healing properties. It contains allantoin, a compound known to aid in wound healing, reduce inflammation, and stimulate the growth of new cells. Traditionally, it has been used in poultices and ointments to treat bruises, sprains, and other injuries. However, it's important to note that comfrey contains alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested in large quantities, and its internal use is controversial and often discouraged.\r\n\r\nComfrey's deep roots are excellent at mining nutrients (especially potassium) from deep within the soil, making these nutrients available to other plants when its leaves decompose. This quality makes comfrey an excellent companion plant in orchards and gardens. Its leaves are often used as mulch or added to compost piles to accelerate decomposition and add rich nutrients.\r\n\r\nComfrey is also beneficial for attracting pollinators and beneficial insects due to its flowers, enhancing the overall health of the garden ecosystem. Moreover, it's used as a “chop and drop” mulch in permaculture, where its leaves are regularly cut and left on the ground to decompose and enrich the soil.\r\n\r\nComfrey is relatively easy to grow and can thrive in a range of soil types, though it prefers moist, well-drained soil. It can tolerate partial shade but grows best in full sun. Once established, comfrey is drought-resistant and requires minimal care. It can be propagated easily from root cuttings, but due to its ability to spread, it's often recommended to grow a sterile hybrid variety like Bocking 14 (Symphytum × uplandicum 'Bocking 14') to prevent it from becoming invasive.","created_at":"2020-11-13T19:10:25.789Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T18:31:07.132Z","scientific_name":"Symphytum officinale","parent_id":null,"adopter_id":1461,"link":"/plants/symphytum-officinale-comfrey-1","thumb":"https://cdn.permapeople.org/xisjyz24yea8a3uqfzcvtjnnbdq3","type":"Species","tags":["Light requirement","Full sun, Partial sun/shade","Water requirement","Moist","Soil type","Light (sandy), Medium, Heavy (clay)","Life cycle","Perennial","Layer","Ground cover","Growth","Fast","Edible","true","Edible parts","Leaves","Family","Boraginaceae","Introduced into","Austria, Belgium, Central European Rus, Connecticut, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Michigan, Netherlands, New York, North Carolina, North European Russi, Norway, Pennsylvania, Spain, Sweden, Vermont, Washington","Pests","Non Deterring","Plants For A Future","https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Symphytum uplandicum","Plants of the World Online","https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:120843-1","Nitrogen Fixing","No","Nitrogen Usage","Light","Potassium Fixing","Yes","USDA Hardiness zone",["4","5","6","7","8"],"Height","up to 5m (~16ft)","Chill hours","not specified","Days to harvest","Days to maturity","Diseases","Drought resistant","Edible uses","Germination temperature","Germination time","Habitat","Medicinal","Medicinal parts","Native to","Propagation -
